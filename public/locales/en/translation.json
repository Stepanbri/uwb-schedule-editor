KIV/UUR introduces the fundamental principles of user interface design. The goal of the project was to build a modern and user-friendly tool for students to plan their schedules before the official course registration opens. Although the project originated as a semester assignment, it is currently under active development, with new features and bug fixes being added. I would like to thank Ing. Richard Lipka, Ph.D., and Ing. Michal Nykl, Ph.D., for their excellent instruction.",

  "faqPage": {
    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)",
    "q1": "What is the UWB Schedule Planner?",
    "a1": "The UWB Schedule Planner is a tool designed for students of the University of West Bohemia to help them visualize and plan their semester schedules. It allows loading courses from STAG, adding them to the schedule, setting preferences, and generating possible schedule variants.",
    "q2": "How can I load my courses?",
    "a2": "You can load courses in several ways: individually using the course code from STAG, collectively for your entire study plan (requires logging into STAG), or by importing a previously saved workspace from a file.",
    "q3": "How does STAG login work? Is it secure?",
    "a3": "To load courses from your study plan, we use the standard STAG login mechanism (via UWB Orion login). You enter your credentials (username and password) directly on the UWB pages; our application does not have access to them. After successful login, we only receive a temporary anonymous key (a \"ticket\"), which allows us to retrieve publicly available information about courses and your study plan. This key is valid for a limited time and does not permit any changes to your studies. The application does not store this key anywhere.",
    "q4": "What does the 'DEMO' mode mean?",
    "a4": "DEMO mode is used for testing and demonstration purposes. When active, all communication is not with the production (live) STAG system, but with its publicly available 'demo' version. Data in the demo STAG may not be up-to-date and is only for development and testing purposes. This mode is useful if you just want to try the application without having to work with real data, or if the production STAG is temporarily unavailable.\n\nYou can activate/deactivate DEMO mode using the button in the toolbar above the schedule (switch icon with 'DEMO' label). When DEMO mode is active, a 'DEMO' indicator is displayed in the top right corner of the application. In this mode, all operations are performed against the demo version of STAG, which means that the loaded data may be outdated or incomplete.",
    "q5": "What happens to my data when I close the application?",
    "a5": "The application saves your workspace (loaded courses, enrolled events, preferences) only in your browser's local storage. This data is not sent to any server and remains solely with you. If you wish, you can export your workspace to a file and later import it again. Clearing browser data or using incognito mode may lead to data loss if not exported.",
    "q6": "Why are some of my courses or schedule events not displaying?",
    "a6": "Ensure you have the correct academic year and semester set for loading courses in the \"Load Course from STAG\" or \"Parameters for Loading Field of Study Courses\" dialogs. Data in STAG may not always be complete, especially for future periods or less common event types. The application only displays data provided by the STAG API. If the problem persists, verify data availability directly in the STAG system.",
    "q7": "Can I officially enroll in courses through this application?",
    "a7": "No. This application is solely for visualizing and planning your schedule. Official enrollment in courses and schedule events must be done through the standard STAG/Portal UWB system within the designated periods.",
    "q8": "I found a bug or have an idea for an improvement. What should I do?",
    "a8": "Great! As this is a student project, feedback is very welcome. To report bugs or suggest new features, please use the 'Issues' tab on the project's GitHub: https://github.com/stepanbri/uwb-schedule-editor/issues.",
    "q9": "Why do I have to log in through an external UWB page?",
    "a9": "This process is called OAuth 2.0 and it is a standard and secure way to grant a third-party application (like this one) limited access to your data without having to share your password with it. By entering your password on the UWB pages, you can be sure that our application will never see it. The application only receives a temporary, limited-validity 'ticket' that authorizes it to retrieve your study data from STAG. It's the same principle as when you log into other services using your Google or Facebook account.",
    "q10": "What do the colors in the schedule mean?",
    "a10": "Schedule events can be color-coded in two ways, which can be switched using a button in the toolbar:\n1. Colors by event type: This is the default mode. Each event type (lecture, practical, seminar) has its own specific color (e.g., red for lectures, green for practicals). This helps to quickly visually distinguish event types in the schedule.\n2. Colors by course: In this mode, each course (e.g., KIV/PPA) is assigned its own unique color. All events belonging to this course will then have this background color. To distinguish the event type, a small colored 'notch' on the left side of each event is used, the color of which corresponds to the color of the event type (lecture, practical...).",
    "q11": "What do the event recurrence abbreviations (EW, EvenW, OddW) mean?",
    "a11": "These abbreviations, taken from the STAG system, determine how often the given schedule event takes place:\n- EW (Every Week): The event takes place every week of the semester.\n- EvenW (Even Week): The event takes place only in the even weeks of the semester.\n- OddW (Odd Week): The event takes place only in the odd weeks of the semester.\n- Once (One-time): The event takes place only on a single specific date."
